From the results we obtained we can make the following conclusions - 
1.Minimum duration - 0.01666667 mins
  Median duration - 8.533333 mins
  Mean duration - 15.99204 mins
  Maximum duration - 33603.73 mins
Since the mean and median duration is not same , so the data is not symmetrical but is either skewed to the left or the right.

2.From the aggregate operation in our analysis we find that casual riders have greater median , mean , max and sum values in duration as compared to members .
Median - 
1                   casual                10.400000
2                   member                 7.816667

Mean -
1                   casual                 25.54757
2                   member                 11.46778

Max -
1                   casual                33603.733
2                   member                 1559.667

Sum - 
1                   casual                 18771816
2                   member                 17796829

3.From 1st plot we can say that casual riders cycled for longer duration of time achieving the highest on the weekends where as the duration for  members were nearly uniform and less than casual riders.

4.From the 2nd plot we infer that number of rides done by members are highest in the weekdays.

5.From 3rd plot we can conclude that members has more number of rides throughout the year as compared to casual riders. The number of rides are less in the winter season and we 
  see a steady increase in the number through the months of feburary , march , april and maximum at september.

Steps that can be taken by the organization - 
Since casual riders rides mostly on weekends , the firm can implement some offers in the weekends so that casual riders become members.
The firm can come up with some discounts in the membership plan during the winter days so that more people use the rental service and in turn increase the revenue.
